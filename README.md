# Project 2: Visual Argument / Rhetorical Collage

**Social Media = Distorted Reality**

With the fast growth of different social media platforms, we can see many negative impacts on mental health. While there are many pros to social media, there are an equal, if not more, drawbacks. Social media can sometimes lead to unrealistic standards, sometimes heightened by follower count and the pressure to get a high number of likes. 

My goal for this project was to show the difference between what we see on our phones, essentially a highlight reel, versus what is actually real life. Hence, the title for my visual argument "distorted reality". Using the image of the trash-filled, dirty beach as the "reality" and a cleaned up, beautiful beach on the phone as the "social media post", I hope to convey this message. What we see online is not really an accurate representation of real life. 

To further this message, I hope that viewers can use the helpful [link](https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/wellbeing/social-media-and-mental-health) to see the cons of extreme social media usage, signs of it impacting your mental health, and how to implement healthy social media habits in your life.
